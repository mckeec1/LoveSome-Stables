    <h2 id="student">Student Information</h2>
    <p>Lovesome Stable Equitherapy was established to provide recreational, educational, therapeutic and social
        opportunities for people with disabilities. Our program helps children, youth and adults (4 and up) improve
        physical capabilities and functional skills while providing students opportunities for physical activities
        and social interaction.</p>

    <p>Experts recognize the significance of the bond formed between man and animal. The student is taught not only how
        to ride, but also how to handle and care for the horse. In turn this large, warm animal provides a symbol of
        strength, stability and friendship for the student.Lessons are designed to challenge the individual, both on and
        off the horse. Instructors use stretches, muscle strengthening, problem solving, communication and sensory
        integration embedded within games and activities.Lovesome stables focuses on abilities rather than disabilities.
        Students of all abilities can safely receive benefits from therapeutic riding with the assistance of a leader
        and two side walkers.</p>

    <h2>Lesson Information</h2>
    <p>Lesson are held on Monday evenings, Wednesday evenings and Saturday mornings.  The cost will be $25 per lesson.
        Payment is due for entire session on or before the first lesson.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Our riding sessions will have one to four riders similar in either age or ability, and will focus on increasing
        individual riding skills while gaining therapeutic benefits. These benefits include increased muscle tone and
        strength, improving eye/hand coordination and balance, improving peer interaction and communication, increasing
        self-esteem, and developing a sense of control. Instructors establish goals for each rider, working with the parents,
        guardian and /or rider, at the beginning of each session. They create a wide variety of games and exercises designed
        to increase the student’s ability to listen, learn and communicate. In addition, all riders work on improving
        their horsemanship skills and a willingness to try new things. Students not only improve riding skills but are
        taught how to groom and tack their horses. The lessons will last approximately 45 minutes.</p>

    <h2 id="job">Volunteer Information</h2>
    <p>Therapeutic riding is made possible through dedicated and trained volunteers. Without the many wonderful
        volunteers who choose to make a difference, our program would not exist. Previous experience with horses is not
        required. Special training sessions are provided for new volunteer staff, these also serve as refreshers for
        established members of our volunteer staff. In addition, to the special training and lecture sessions,
        instruction is ongoing throughout the lesson periods. For most areas of the program you will not need a special
        skill. You just need the desire to give your time... we can almost guarantee you will receive more than you give!
