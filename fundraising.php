        <p>The cost for shoeing, feed and veterinarian services are our highest expenses.   Some of our older horses
            require special supplements that cost as much as $100 per month.   In an effort to help offset these costs,
            we want to offer each of you the opportunity to sponsor your favorite equine.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Adopt a Horse sponsors are recognized for their contribution in many ways:
            - Horseshoe frame and name plate on our Horseshoes of Support Wall in the arena
            - Horseshoe frame with horse’s photo to display in your home or office
            - Adoption announcement in our newsletter
            - Recognition on this website with link to your site, if desired
