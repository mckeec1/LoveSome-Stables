    <h2 id="student">Special Olympic Shows</h2>
    <p>Each year we take some of our riders to compete with other riders from across the state in the Special Olymics
        Equestrian competition at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington.  This year we took 12 students and 4 horses and
        had a blast.  </p>

    <p>All of our students are invited to compete in our semi-annual horse shows as well.  Our spring show this year was
        sponsored in part by Special Olympics and students from other theraputic riding programs in Northern Kentucky
        were invited to attend.  The students love getting to show off and enjoy earning medals and t-shirts for their efforts.
        Although they are judged and ranked based on equestrian skills, all students recieve awards.
        This is also a great time for families to network and connect with others dealing with similar circumstances.</p>
